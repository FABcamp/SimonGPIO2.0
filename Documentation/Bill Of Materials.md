 For the Soldering section, some parts can be reused from Breadboard section of the project. PCB costs will depend on your fabhouse. We got 65 for $500 from [Bay Area Circuits][10]. You will also need solder, soldering irons, copper wick, etc. Make sure to buy extra components in case some get destroyed during assembly!
