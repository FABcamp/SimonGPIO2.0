######This document will guide future instructors how to set-up and teach the SimonGPIO-2.0 project to middle-school aged students

This project makes use of the [Raspberry Pi Microcomputer](http://www.raspberrypi.org) to teach students how to design circuits, solder, and program a device of their own. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that costs around $35 on its own, and can be used to teach both electrical engineering and programming. The device is in use worldwide in education to encourage students to join the fields of electrical and software engineering. 

In 2014, UCI made us of this project in 2 camps, the APPcamp and FABcamp2.0 camps over a course of 2 weeks. Both camps used slight variations on the same project to fit the individual topics of the camps. 

The project is made up of several units. Students must write the scratch code for the device, breadboard the circuit, solder the components, design and print the cases, and finish the assembly. APPcamp did not assemble any cases or solder the PCBs, instead focusing on code design and a second project. FABcamp worked through all of it, but breadboarding was instead shared in groups of 2, and with less help from the instructors during the coding.
