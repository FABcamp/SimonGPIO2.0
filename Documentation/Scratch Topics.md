Scratch Topics to Cover for Fabcamp and Appcamp
===============================================

1. Variables
  - how are they like variables in algebra? 
    - can change in value
    - store a value
    - can be added to/subtracted from
    - takes the place of a number in an equation 
  - how are they unlike variables in algebra?
    - can store strings (words)
    - can either set a value, or compare the value
  - how can we set `Time = (Time * 0.9)` 
    - `Time * 0.9` can take the place of a value
2. Lists
  - how do they work?
  - why do we need to reset them each game?
  - what are our lists storing
  - how are we playing each tone? 
    - how does our index work?
    - how do we know which tone to play?
3. Looping
  - how do loops work?
  - how are a forever loop and a repeat() loop different? (repeat(foo) loop only repeats foo times, forever loops loop forever).
  - how do blocks inside the loop act differently from blocks outside the loop
  - why cant you place blocks below a forever block?
4. Conditionals
  - Why are we waiting for `Length of(CPU_tones) == Length of(Player_tones)`?
  - how do Ifs work?
  - how are if-elses different from Ifs?
  - why are we looping ifs to check the buttons?
5. Broadcasts
  - how do broadcasts work?
  - how do broadcasts call other chunks of code?
  - how do broadcasts control the GPIO
